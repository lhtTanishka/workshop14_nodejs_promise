This project demonstrates the usage of JavaScript Promises to handle asynchronous API calls in Node.js. It fetches a random dog image from the Dog API and logs a success message with the image URL if the API call is successful. In case of an error, it catches and logs the error with an appropriate message. The project serves as a beginner-friendly example to understand the basics of Promises, error handling, and asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It is designed to help developers get comfortable with handling asynchronous requests, making it a perfect starting point for those exploring JavaScript and Node.js.
